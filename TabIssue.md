The Chrome browser is converting the tabs in the below rendered code block to spaces. 
When copied to the clipboard, there are spaces where tabs should be.
When viewing the source, it is obvious that they are tabs. 
When editing the mark down via github.com's editor, they are tabs. 

`col_1	col_2	col_3	col_4	col_5	col_6	col_7	col_8	col_9	col_10	col_11`
